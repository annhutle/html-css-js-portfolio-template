# MY PERSONAL PORTFOLIO
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
I created this website for my personal portfolio. Where I can show everyone can see what skills I have or know more about me. This website is where in the future I will put my personal projects. I used HTML/CSS/Javascript in order to create this website. I used all the knowledge that I have learned in week 8 to create this newbie website. I hope you will like it and feel free to judge my website, and I'm always welcome for your recommendation. Thank you very much, CS50, for this wonderful course.
